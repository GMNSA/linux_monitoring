### Bash

>Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system.
>
>The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.
>
>Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It  offers functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming use.
>
>While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a version of csh, Bash is the default shell. Like other GNU software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-      supported ports exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms.

### Shell

>At its base, a shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands.
>
>A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. Files containing commands can be created, and become commands themselves. These new commands   have the same status as system commands, allowing users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their common tasks.
>
>Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.
>
>A shell allows execution of GNU commands, both synchronously and asynchronously.
>
>While executing commands is essential, most of the power (and complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages. Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables, flow control constructs, quoting, and functions.
>
>Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather than to augment the programming language. These interactive features include job control, command line editing, command history and aliases.

There was a folder labeled "materials" underneath the article clippings in Mike's drawer. As you looked in it, you found several sheets describing the features of the bash scripts.
